/// A collection of properties that you use to initialize a MarkupEditor web view.
///
/// A MarkupWKWebViewConfiguration object provides information about how to configure a MarkupWKWebView object. 
/// Use your configuration object to specify:
///
/// * A Javascript file script that should be loaded after the MarkupWKWebView has loaded the `markup.js` file.
/// The file name is specified and must be provided as part of the app bundle using the MarkupEditor.
///
/// * A CSS file that should be loaded after the MarkupWKWebView has loaded the `markup.css` file. 
/// The file name is specified and must be provided as part of the app bundle using the MarkupEditor.
///
/// * Top-level attributes for the `editor` element in `markup.html`. By default, the entire `editor` 
/// is editable, but will not perform spell check. Autocorrect is enabled by default because without it,
/// the iOS keyboard will not supply suggestions.
///
/// You create a MarkupWKWebViewConfiguration object in your code, configure its properties, and pass it to the initializer
/// of your WKWebView object. The web view incorporates your configuration settings only at creation time; you cannot change
/// those settings dynamically later.
